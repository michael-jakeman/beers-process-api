      "name": "11.5° PLATO",
      "description": "The Plato scale is a measurement of the density of liquid. The number tells brewers how big or small a resulting beer will be—the larger the number the bigger the beer. We designed 11.5° Plato—a lower number on the beer scale—to give us just enough body to support a heavy heap of hops. The result is an easy-drinking session IPA which satisfies the thirst for hops, but urges you to have another round.",
